# ScriptKit

Single command line utility to turn an es6/es2016 script with requires/imports into a standalone file for use in browser.  No more dealing with configurations, install and run.

## Features

* Uses babel to turn es2015 code that is compatible with older browsers
* Uses rollup to combine depedencies and remove unneeded code
* Lint your js files using eslint
* Uglify to minify your code
* File watcher to rebuild when files change
* Runs `npm test` after build or when files change
* Support for live reload
* Static file serving (great for example files)
* Configuration all done in package.json (no need for additional config files)
